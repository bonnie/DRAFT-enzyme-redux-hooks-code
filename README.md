# DRAFT: Enzyme React Hooks Code

Draft of code for Enzyme tests of React Hooks code, meant for [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/?referralCode=3A42BF689E28CADB0587) on Udemy.

The course revision including instruction with this code has been on hold, pending the official release of the [Enzyme adapter for React 17](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/pull/2430).

I am making this code available in the hopes that it will help students with examples of how to write tests with React Hooks, before the revision is available. Please direct questions via Q&A for the above Udemy course.
